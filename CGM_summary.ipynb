    "### The base model\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors' aim is to represent the life cycle of a consumer that is exposed to uninsurable labor income risk and chooses how to allocate his savings bet\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dynamic problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of an agent $i$ of age $t$ in the base model is recursively represented as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "V_{i,t} =& \\max_{0\\leq C_{i,t} \\leq X_{i,t}, \\alpha_{i,t}\\in[0,1]} U(C_{i,t}) + \\delta p_t E_t\\{ V_{i,t+1} (X_{i,t+1}) \\}\\\\\n",

    "where $C_{i,t}$ is consumption, $\\alpha_{i,t}$ is the share of savings allocated to the risky asset, $Y_{i,t}$ is labor income, and $X_{i,t}$ represents wealth. The utility function $U(\\cdot)$ is assumed to be CRRA in the base model. The discount factor is $\\delta$ and $p_t$ is the probability of survival from $t$ to $t+1$. Death is certain at a maximum period $T$.\n",

    "#### Labor income\n",
    "\n",
    "An important driver of the paper's results is the labor income process. It is specified as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\ln Y_{i,t} = f(t,Z_{i,t}) + v_{i,t} + \\epsilon_{i,t}, \\quad \\text{for } t\\leq K.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K$ is the (exogenous) age of retirement, $Z_{i,t}$ are demographic characteristics, $\\epsilon_{i,t}\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_\\epsilon)$ is a transitory shock, and  $v_{i,t}$ is a permanent component following a random walk\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "v_{i,t} = v_{i,t-1} + u_{i,t} = v_{i,t-1} + \\xi_t + \\omega_{i,t}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "in which the innovation is decomposed into an aggregate ($\\xi_t$) and an idiosyncratic component ($\\omega_{i,t}$), both following mean-0 normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-retirement income is a constant fraction $\\lambda$ of income in the last working year $K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial aspect of the labor income process is that $f(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is calibrated to match income profiles in the PSID, capturing the usual humped shape of income across lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assets and their returns\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two assets available for consumers to allocate their savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bonds: paying a risk-free return $\\bar{R}_f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stocks: paying a stochastic return $R_t = \\bar{R}_f + \\mu + \\eta_t$, where the stochastic component $\\eta_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2_\\eta)$ is allowed to be correlated with the aggregate labor income innovation $\\xi_t$."
