    "\n",
    "In the presence of rate-of-return heterogeneity, capital income taxes disproportionately affect productive entrepreneurs. Switching to wealth taxation moves the tax burden towards unproductive entrepreneurs and increases after-tax return heterogeneity, which elicits a reallocation of capital towards productive entrepreneurs. The increased efficiency and the expanded tax base increase output and allow the government to reduce labor income taxes. The authors therefore conclude that wealth taxation can increase efficiency and output while decreasing consumption inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through simulation exercises calibrated to match U.S. data, the authors find that the optimal wealth tax rate is around 3%."
